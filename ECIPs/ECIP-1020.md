### Abstract
Make ⟠ the Ethereum Classic currency symbol.   This is Unicode code (U+27E0) . See here: http://graphemica.com/%E2%9F%A0
### Motivation
Ethereum Classic needs its own distinct currency symbol.  The ⟠ symbol looks like the Ethereum Classic logo and is clean and simple.
### Specification
### Rationale
### Implementation


The proposed conventions are based on the *current* standard currency code, "ETC", and the *de facto* standard logo on the ETC website.  It is only necessary to continue using them and avoid other choices whenever possible.  The SI or metric prefixes are already well known throughout the entire world and will be immediately recognized without any effort needed:

The choice that will likely get used the most, in addition to ETC, is aETC since many objects in software denote funds using this smallest possible division of currency.
