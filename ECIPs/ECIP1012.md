### Abstract
This ECIP describes the process of traversing all accounts in the existing state DB to increment the nonce by a large number ```n```. Also, new accounts will be initialized with nonce ```n```.

### Motivation
This will prevent further issues of the replay attack.

in order to prevent replay attacks, every transaction must have a "[nonce](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale)", such that the account keeps track of the nonces used and only accepts a transaction if its nonce is 1 after the last nonce used.

### Specification
