    Title: Rename SHA3 References To Keccak-256

### Abstract

Due to the [SHA3 parameter controversy](https://steemit.com/etc/@cseberino/why-ethereum-classic-uses-an-incorrect-sha3-implementation), Ethereum and Ethereum Classic
ended up using a similar but different hash function from the Keccak family that
is today referred to as Keccak-256.  There are several places where the
Keccak-256 is incorrectly referred to as SHA3 which will continue to cause
confusion until this is addressed.  As a start, I am proposing a keccak256 alias addition to the JSONRPC library.  
This will have the added benefit of being in agreement with recent Ethereum Solidity corrections and Ethereum Improvement Proposals such as EIP-59.

### Motivation

Ignoring this error will lead to ongoing confusion in both Ethereum
and Ethereum Classic communities such as
[here](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/559/why-arent-solidity-sha3-hashes-not-matching-what-other-sha3-libraries-produce).

### Specification

A keccak256 alias to JSONRPC web3 module would be an easy yet
hugely beneficial start.  Deprecation warnings could eventually be added to 
references for later removal.

### Rationale

Ethereum is already taking steps to address this
and there is no reason for Ethereum Classic references to remain incorrect.
[Solidity 0.4.3](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/solidity/stable/solidity.pdf)
for Ethereum introduced the keccak256 alias already and this would bring Ethereum Classic
in agreement with that addition.

### Implementation
