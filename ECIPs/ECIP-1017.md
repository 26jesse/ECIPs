### Abstract

This ECIP proposes a solution to the Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy to adjust, with finality, the current emission schedule implementation of 14.0625ETC per block, in perpetuity. The solution proposed introduces a theoretical upper bound on the maximum absolute number of ETC and introduces a method of degraded emission over time. In addition, this ECIP describes the requirements associated with maintaining this emission schedule through a potential change of the network’s consensus algorithm, from its current Ethash based Proof of Work to a possible POS or POW/POS hybrid model.

### Motivation

At its core, the purpose of adjusting the current monetary policy of the ETC network to a policy which places an upper bound on the number of tokens issued and decreases the rate at which ETC is introduced into the system over time, is to "bootstrap" the network’s security. By increasing the security of the network, a proper monetary policy indirectly nurtures the network, providing a secure platform for which smart contract development will be more likely to occur.

If we accept that speculation, a demand function, is the main economic driver of any new system, that the Ethereum Classic Network is a new system, and that speculation will drive the value of the Ethereum Classic token until the utility value of the Ethereum Classic token exceeds its speculative value, it is reasonable to assume that rewarding speculation will help to secure and nurture the network:

Large scale, high risk, and/or high profile applications will be less likely to be developed on a blockchain with weak security ie. a low hashrate. Increasing demand for the Ethereum Classic token will, all else being equal, increase the price of the Ethereum Classic token.  An increase in the price of the token incentivizes mining operations to direct their efforts on the Ethereum Classic Network or to begin operations on the Ethereum Classic Network. The additional mining power that is directed towards the Ethereum Classic network, because of this incentive, further secures the network. An increase in the security of the network assists in building trust between the network and both current and potential users and developers of the network. This increase of trust in the network provides an incentive for large scale, high risk, and/or high profile applications to be developed on the Ethereum Classic network. Thus, rewarding speculation helps to secure and nurture the Ethereum Classic network. 

Especially important to early stage cryptocurrencies, assuming all other variables are equal, a network with a decreasing rate of production and an upper bound on the number of tokens that will be issued will provide more incentive for high risk speculation to occur than one without a known rate of production or upper bound. 

Above all, it is important to recognize that a monetary policy does not directly create value for the network. A stable platform with useful applications and a vibrant community are the variables that drive value. The purpose of a properly structured monetary policy is to create an incentive for people to take a risk on a system that has not yet reached its full potential, providing an additional reason for those who may not otherwise be interested, who cannot or have not developed anything on the platform (yet), or who remain skeptical, to involve themselves in an otherwise nascent platform. 

### Specification

Current Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy

[Source](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/mining.html)

The current mining rewards on the Ethereum Classic Network are as follows:

* A "static" block reward for the winning block of 5 ETC

* An extra reward to the winning miner for including uncles as part of the block, in the form of an extra 1/32 (0.15625ETC) per uncle included, up to a maximum of two (2) uncles. 

* A reward of 7/8 (4.375ETC) of the winning block reward for a miner who has mined an uncled block and has that uncle included in the winning block by the winning miner, up to a maximum of two (2) uncles included in a winning block.

* This reward structure is set to continue in perpetuity.

* *An "Era" is defined as the number of blocks containing a given production rate.*

The proposed mining rewards on the Ethereum Classic Network are as follows:

* Era 1 (blocks 1 - 5,000,000)

    * A "static" block reward for the winning block of 5 ETC

    * An extra reward to the winning miner for including uncles as part of the block, in the form of an extra 1/32 (0.15625ETC) per uncle included, up to a maximum of two (2) uncles. 

    * A reward of 7/8 of the winning block reward (4.375ETC) for a miner who has mined an uncled block and has that uncle included in the winning block by the winning miner, up to a maximum of two (2) uncles included in a winning block.

* Era 2 (blocks 5,000,001 - 10,000,000)

    * A "static" block reward for the winning block of 4 ETC

    * An extra reward to the winning miner for including uncles as part of the block, in the form of an extra 1/32 (0.125ETC) per uncle included, up to a maximum of two (2) uncles. 

    * A reward of 1/32 (0.125ETC) of the winning block reward for a miner who has mined an uncled block and has that uncle included in the winning block by the winning miner, up to a maximum of two (2) uncles included in a winning block.

    * Era 2 represents a reduction of 20% of Era 1 values, while also reducing uncle rewards to uncle miners to be the same as the reward to the winning miner for including the uncle(s).

* Era 3+

    * All rewards will be reduced at a constant rate of 20% upon entering a new Era. 

    * Every Era will last for 5,000,000 blocks. 

Maintenance of the Economic Policy through a transition of the network consensus algorithm.** **

Should the Ethereum Classic Network decide to change its consensus algorithm to a model other than the current Ethash based POW implementation, the following requirements will be adhered to ensure the finality of the implemented Monetary Policy:

* Maintain a total network rate of emission no higher than the upper bound (block reward plus reward for two uncles included per block) rate of emission per block over time as adopted in the emission schedule for the current Ethash based POW algorithm. 

* Maintain a total network rate of emission no lower than the lower bound (block reward only) rate of emission per block over time as adopted in the emission schedule for the current Ethash based POW algorithm.

* Maintain a rate of emission that is equal to the Ethash based POW model of 15 second rewards over a no longer than 60 second period.

For example, assume that the Ethereum Classic chooses to hard fork the blockchain at block 7,500,000 in order to introduce a new consensus algorithm, based on a POW/POS hybrid model. In this hypothetical scenario, the new algorithm enables blocks to be confirmed by POS nodes at 5 second intervals, 10 times per minute and POW blocks, consisting of the blocks produced by the POS nodes, at 1 min intervals. 

The method by which the network chooses to award both POS and POW participants is beyond the scope of this explanation, but what is important to note is that the range in which the total award is allowed: 

* Block 7,500,000 is in Era 2

* The maximum reward/emission in Era 2 is 4.5 ETC every 15 seconds, assuming a the maximum of two uncles is included per block

* The minimum reward/emission in Era 2 is 4.0 ETC every 15 seconds, assuming no uncles are included in the winning block.

In the scenario where the network moves to a POW/POS hybrid model, the upper bound allowable to the new model, in terms of emission rate, is 4.5 ETC every 15 seconds or an equivalent rate produced no longer than every 60 seconds (18 ETC/min). The lower bound allowable to the new model, in terms of emission rate, is 4.0 ETC every 15 seconds, or an equivalent rate produced no longer than every 60 seconds (16 ETC/min).

Additionally, an adjustment by this hybrid model is required to deprecate the rate of emission per Era of time. This Era of time is set at  the equivalent of the proposed emission rate of 5,000,000 blocks and assumes a time of 15s between blocks. So by the equivalent of block 10,000,000, the new model is to reduce its emission rate by 20%, and will continue this 20% every 5,000,000 blocks or equivalent in time, in perpetuity. 

### Rationale

Why this 5M20 model:

* Minimizes making the first adjustment too "exceptional." Other than equalizing all uncle rewards at block 5M, the changes/reductions to supply over time are equal. 

* The model is easy to understand. Every 5M blocks, total reward is reduced by 20%.

* Uncle inclusion rates through block 5M will likely remain at around the 5%. Because of this, once block 5M is reached, in the worst case scenario (supply wise, which assumes two uncles included every block in perpetuity) the total supply will not exceed 210.7M ETC. Should the network remain as efficient in its ability to propagate found blocks as it has in Era 1 (5.4% uncle rate), the total supply will not be less than 198.5M ETC. This provides for an incentive to miners and client developers to maintain high standards and maintenance of their hardware and software they introduce into the network.

* The 5M model provides a balance between providing an acceptable depreciating distribution rate for rewarding high risk investment into the system, and maintaining an active supply production over time, maintaining a future supply rate and keeping that potential price of the ethereum token suppressed enough to ensure transaction prices can remain lower than if the supply were to reduce to zero at an earlier date. This serves as a "blow off valve" for price increase in the case that a dynamic gas model cannot be implemented for the foreseeable future. 

* Having the monetary policy begin at 5M provides a balance between delaying the implementation to provide enough time for code development and testing, and accelerating the implementation to provide an incentive to potential early adopters and high risk investors. Based on observance of community discussion, <4M is too soon for development, testing, and implementation of the policy, and >6M is too long to interest many potential early adopters/speculators. 

* Not changing the monetary policy of ETC provides no benefit to risk taking early on in the life of the system, speculation wise. It will be difficult for the network to bootstrap its security. While bitcoin has what could be considered an ideal monetary policy, with its 50% reduction every four years, this model is not likely to yield optimal investment for ETC. If ETC were to adopt the bitcoin halving model, it is arguable that too much of the supply would be produced too soon: 50% of the estimated total supply would be mined 75% sooner than traditional bitcoin because of the pre-mine of 72M ETC that was initially created. While the 5M model does not completely eliminate the effects of the premine, since 50% of total estimated production occurs sooner than would the bitcoin model, it makes up for this, to an extent, with its lengthening of the time until 90%, 99% and 100% of bitcoin are mined. The tail end of ETC production is longer and wider than bitcoin. 

* In the current ETC reward schedule, the total reward for uncles is higher than the reward received by the miner who also includes uncles. In this state, a miner is actually diluting the value of his reward by including these uncled blocks. By equalizing the rewards to uncle block miners with the rewards to miners who include an uncle block, the reward structure is more fairly distributed.

* Because the rate at which uncled blocks can vary with extreme, reducing the reward for uncle blocks assists considerably with being able to forecast the true upper bound of the total ETC that will ultimately exist in the system. 

* The model is the best attempt at balancing the needs to incentive high risk investment into the system in order to bootstrap security and create a potential user base, be easy to understand, include a reduction to the rate of production of ETC over time, include an upper bound on supply, and also provide for a long term production of the ETC token.
