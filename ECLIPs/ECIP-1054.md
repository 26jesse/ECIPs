### Simple Summary

Enable the Ethereum Foundation network protocol _Byzantium_ upgrades on the Ethereum Classic network.

### Abstract

Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
_Byzantium_ hardfork. The proposed changes include:

- Byzantium EVM opcodes, namely:
  - `REVERT` (EIP-140)
  - `RETURNDATASIZE` and `RETURNDATACOPY` (EIP-211)
  - `STATICCALL` (EIP-214)
- Byzantium EVM precompiled contracts, namely:
  - addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128 (EIP-196)
  - optimal ate pairing check on the elliptic curve alt_bn128 (EIP-197)
  - BIGINT modular exponentiation (EIP-198)
- Replacing the intermediate state root field in transaction receipts with the contract return status (EIP-658).
- Change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time including uncle (EIP-100)

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:

- `X_XXX_XXX` on Ethereum Classic mainnet
- `X_XXX_XXX` on Morden Classic testnet
- `X_XXX_XXX` on Kotti Classic testnet

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

### Motivation

To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes and precompiled contracts shall be added
to the Ethereum Classic networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since late 2017.
Adoption of the _receipt status_ feature provides a helpful method for decentralized-application developers to access
the successful or failed state of a contract. This would establish a higher level of interoperability between Foundation
and Classic EVMs, and make a more extensive array of tooling available for the ETC network (e.g., Solidity version,
contract debugging tools). The proposed change to the difficulty formula ensures that the difficulty adjustment
algorithm targets a constant average rate of blocks produced including uncles, and so ensures a highly predictable
issuance rate that cannot be manipulated upward by manipulating the uncle rate.

### Specification

Technical specifications for each EIP can be found at those documents respectively:

- [EIP 100](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-100) (Change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time including uncles)
- [EIP 140](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-140) (REVERT instruction in the Ethereum Virtual Machine)
- [EIP 196](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-196) (Precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128)
- [EIP 197](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-197) (Precompiled contracts for optimal ate pairing check on the elliptic curve alt_bn128)
- [EIP 198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-198) (Precompiled contract for bigint modular exponentiation)
- [EIP 211](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-211) (New opcodes: RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY)
- [EIP 214](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-214) (New opcode STATICCALL)
- [EIP 658](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-658) (Embedding transaction status code in receipts)

### Rationale

This protocol specification notably omits the scheduled features of the anticipated _Constantinople_ protocol upgrade,
which would be expected to include various further EVM upgrades. The reasoning for this omission hinges on a hedge
toward battle-testing of those changes in light of multiple delays of that fork
([here](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/a-post-mortem-report-the-constantinople-ethereum-hard-fork-postponement-dd780d7ae63d),
a postmortem of the latest delay) due to security and implementation discrepancies.

__Interoperability__: establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior between Ethereum clients is essential for
developers and end-user adoption, yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETH and ETC, Ropsten and Morden,
GÃ¶rli and Kotti).

__On Immutability__: Introducing new opcodes in the EVM has the potential to change the behavior of existing contracts;
in the case where previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode series (yielding _invalid opcode_) would now be assigned a
meaning and thus could generate or return a value other than _invalid_. In essence, this means _"possibly making music
where there was only noise before."_ There is a concern that this behavior change contradicts an essential promise of
Immutability, since an existing failing smart contract is liable to become a succeeding (not failing) contract, albeit
in a hypothetical case of extreme coincidence and gross misuse of an opcode. In counterargument to this concern are two
critical points:

1. Account states remain unchanged.
2. The _Homestead_ upgrade established a precedent for this type of change, having introduced the `DELEGATECALL` opcode
at block `1_150_000`.

With these arguments in place, along with precedence and expectation for other continuing and varied consensus-impacting
protocol upgrades (e.g., soft- and hard-forks), it follows that the definition of immutability is not extended to
guarantee perfect consistency for future _behavior_ of historical account states, but only to only to guarantee the
immutability of the account states themselves.

Adding opcodes and precompiled contracts to the EVM increases its functionality and should be considered a feature
upgrade rather than a modification.

### Implementation

Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the Byzantium features:

- Multi Geth: all Byzantium features
- Parity Ethereum: all Byzantium features
- Geth Classic: partial support for EIP-658 receipt status code change
