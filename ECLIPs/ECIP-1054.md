    ECIP: 1054
    Title: Support for Byzantium EVM and Protocol Upgrades
    Status: Draft
    Type: Standards Track

### Simple Summary

Enable the Ethereum Foundation _Byzantium_ network protocol upgrades on the Ethereum Classic network.

### Abstract

Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
_Byzantium_ hardfork. The proposed changes include:

- Byzantium EVM opcodes, namely `REVERT`, `RETURNDATASIZE`, `RETURNDATACOPY`, and `STATICCALL`.
- Byzantium EVM precompiled contracts, namely addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve `alt_bn128`,
  optimal ate pairing check on the elliptic curve `alt_bn128`, and BIGINT modular exponentiation.
- Replacing the intermediate state root field in transaction receipts with the contract return status.
- Change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time including uncle.

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:

- `X_XXX_XXX` on Ethereum Classic mainnet (_TBD_)
- `X_XXX_XXX` on Morden Classic testnet (_TBD_)
- `X_XXX_XXX` on Kotti Classic testnet (_TBD_)

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

### Motivation

To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes and precompiled contracts shall be added
to the Ethereum Classic networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since late 2017.
Adoption of the _receipt status_ feature provides a helpful method for decentralized-application developers to access
the successful or failed state of a contract. This would establish a higher level of interoperability between Foundation
and Classic EVMs, and make a more extensive array of tooling available for the ETC network (e.g., Solidity version,
contract debugging tools). The proposed change to the difficulty formula ensures that the difficulty adjustment
algorithm targets a constant average rate of blocks produced including uncles, and so ensures a highly predictable
issuance rate that cannot be manipulated upward by manipulating the uncle rate.

### Specification

Technical specifications for each EIP can be found at those documents respectively:

- [EIP 100](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-100) (Change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time including uncles)
- [EIP 140](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-140) (`REVERT` instruction in the Ethereum Virtual Machine)
- [EIP 196](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-196) (Precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve `alt_bn128`)
- [EIP 197](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-197) (Precompiled contracts for optimal ate pairing check on the elliptic curve `alt_bn128`)
- [EIP 198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-198) (Precompiled contract for BIGINT modular exponentiation)
- [EIP 211](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-211) (New opcodes `RETURNDATASIZE` and `RETURNDATACOPY`)
- [EIP 214](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-214) (New opcode `STATICCALL`)
- [EIP 658](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-658) (Embedding transaction status code in receipts)

### Rationale

__Atomicity__: This protocol specification notably omits the scheduled features of the anticipated _Constantinople_
protocol upgrade, which would be expected to include various further EVM upgrades. This allows for dedicated testing of
the proposed changes in light of multiple delays of the Constantinople fork
([a postmortem of the latest delay](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/a-post-mortem-report-the-constantinople-ethereum-hard-fork-postponement-dd780d7ae63d)).

__Interoperability__: establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior between Ethereum clients is essential for
developers and end-user adoption, yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETH and ETC, Ropsten and Morden,
GÃ¶rli and Kotti).

__Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the potential to change the behavior of existing
contracts; in the case where previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the network, none of
them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes and precompiled
contracts to the EVM increases its functionality and should be considered a feature upgrade rather than a modification.

### Implementation

Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the Byzantium features currently:

- Multi Geth: all Byzantium features due to Ethereum Foundation compatibility
- Parity Ethereum: all Byzantium features due to Ethereum Foundation compatibility
- Geth Classic: partial support for EIP-658 receipt status code change
